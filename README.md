# mpdl
Smart playlist generator for MPD

Based on seemingly abandoned mpdq

`mpdlupd` is zenity frontend and script aggregator

I like opus format instead of mp3. You can use `mpdl` itself for mp3s but not the other scripts

Also I use Beets as autotagger for music. Take a look at beets.io
Okay.

`mpdl` is basic script

Usage:

Create folder `~/.config/mpdl/` and copy `mpdl.rc` there.

Edit mpdl.rc

`mpdl` starts script

`mpdl -s` to load song database

`mpdl -g` to write user defined genre connections

`mpdl -f` does both

`mpdl -j` - 'drift' mode for drunk Fridays

Bash scripts in the folder:

Too lazy to describe it all. There's all the info in the `mpdlupd`.
