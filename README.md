# mpdl
Smart playlist generator for MPD

Based on seemingly abandoned mpdq

`mpdlupd` is zenity frontend and script aggregator
I like opus format instead of mp3. You can use `mpdl` itself for mp3s but not the other scripts
Also I use Beets as autotagger for music. Take a look at beets.io
Okay.

`mpdl` is basic script
Usage:

Create folder `~/.config/mpdl/` and copy `mpdl.rc` there.
Edit mpdl.rc

`mpdl` starts script
`mpdl -s` to load song database
`mpdl -g` to write user defined genre connections
`mpdl -f` does both
`mpdl -j` - 'drift' mode for drunk Fridays

Bash scripts in the folder:
Too lazy to describe it all. There's all the info in the `mpdlupd`.
